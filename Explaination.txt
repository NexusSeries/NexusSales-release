Project Details
1. MarketingApp.UI (WPF Application)
•	Contains: MainWindow.xaml, user controls, styles, templates, and ViewModels.
•	References: Core, Services, Data, Utils.
•	Implements: MVVM pattern, data binding, commands, resources, styles, control templates, user controls.
2. MarketingApp.Core
•	Contains: Business models (Message, Post, Comment, UserAccount, etc.), interfaces, enums, core logic.
•	No dependencies on UI or external services.
3. MarketingApp.Services
•	Contains: Service classes for Facebook/Messenger API, AI chat integration, etc.
•	Implements: Interfaces from Core.
•	Handles: API calls, serialization/deserialization, external communication.
4. MarketingApp.Data
•	Contains: Data access logic (e.g., Entity Framework DbContext, repositories, local storage).
•	Handles: CRUD operations, data caching, local/remote DB.
5. MarketingApp.Utils (Optional)
•	Contains: Utility classes, converters, extension methods, common helpers.
6. MarketingApp.Tests
•	Contains: Unit tests for Core, Services, Data, and ViewModels.
•	Uses: Test frameworks like MSTest, NUnit, or xUnit.
---
Architectural Pattern
•	MVVM: Strict separation of View, ViewModel, and Model.
•	Dependency Injection: Use a DI container (e.g., Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection) for managing dependencies, especially for services and ViewModels.

Next Steps
1.	Create the Solution and Projects
In Visual Studio:
•	Add a new WPF App (.NET Framework) project: MarketingApp.UI
•	Add Class Library (.NET Framework) projects: MarketingApp.Core, MarketingApp.Services, MarketingApp.Data, MarketingApp.Utils
•	Add a Unit Test project: MarketingApp.Tests
•	Set project references as needed (UI references all others, Services references Core, Data references Core, etc.)
2.	Set Up MVVM
•	Create base ViewModel and Model classes in Core.
•	Implement ViewModels in UI.
•	Use data binding and commands in XAML.
3.	Implement Services
•	Define interfaces in Core (e.g., IMessengerService, IFacebookService).
•	Implement them in Services.
4.	Implement Data Access
•	Define repository interfaces in Core.
•	Implement them in Data.
5.	Configure Dependency Injection
•	Set up DI in App.xaml.cs or a bootstrapper class.

This structure will keep your codebase clean, modular, and easy to maintain as your application grows. If you need, I can provide example code for the initial setup of each project or for MVVM basics. Let me know how you’d like to proceed!
