Chapter 1: Project Architecture Blueprint
==========================================
Instruction to Create and Maintain the "Common Mistakes.md" File and i need you to read it more than once and study it 1000000000% and fully understand it 10000000000000000%
"Okay Copilot, I'm adding a new file to our solution for quality and learning purposes. This file is called Common Mistakes.md.

Your task is to populate and maintain this file based on our interactions and any code you generate.

Here are your specific instructions for this task:

File Creation: The very first time you receive this instruction, create a new file named Common Mistakes.md in the root of the Solution Items folder within the Nexus Sales solution.

Initial Content: The file should start with a clear header. For example:

Markdown

# Common Development Mistakes and Lessons Learned

This document serves as a log of common errors, misconceptions, or security vulnerabilities identified during our development process. Its purpose is to act as a knowledge base to prevent recurring mistakes.
Logging a Mistake: Whenever you make a suggestion or generate code that is later corrected, pointed out as a mistake, or identified as a potential vulnerability by me (the user), you MUST add a new entry to this file.

Mistake Entry Format: Each entry must be clearly structured with the following format:

Markdown

## YYYY-MM-DD: [Brief, Descriptive Title of the Mistake]

### **The Mistake:**
[A clear, concise explanation of the error, the flawed assumption, or the vulnerability. Include a code snippet of the incorrect approach if applicable.]

### **The Correct Approach:**
[A detailed explanation of the right way to do it, including the correct code or design pattern.]

### **Why it's Important:**
[Explain the consequences of the mistake—e.g., "This could lead to a SQL Injection attack," "This creates a concurrency bug," or "This violates our architectural pattern."]
Proactive Learning: Before generating any new code for complex structures (like data access, security logic, or business workflows), you should mentally "check" this Common Mistakes.md file. Your generated code should demonstrate that you have learned from these past mistakes and have incorporated the correct practices.

Confirmation: Acknowledge this instruction. Confirm that you understand the purpose of the Common Mistakes.md file and that you will actively maintain it based on our interactions."

1. Error Handling Example

var dialog = new MessageDialog(
    "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again.",
    "Error",
    soundFileName: "Warning.wav",
    titleColor: (Brush)Application.Current.FindResource("FontWarningBrush")
);
dialog.ShowDialog();

2. Success Notification Example

var dialog = new MessageDialog(
    "Operation completed successfully.",
    "Success",
    soundFileName: "Success.wav",
    titleColor: (Brush)Application.Current.FindResource("FontSuccessfulBrush")
);
dialog.ShowDialog();

3. Warning/Validation Example

var dialog = new MessageDialog(
    "Please fill in all required fields.",
    "Warning",
    soundFileName: "Warning.wav",
    titleColor: (Brush)Application.Current.FindResource("FontWarningBrush")
);
dialog.ShowDialog();

4. Info/Status Example

var dialog = new MessageDialog(
    "Data has been refreshed.",
    "Information",
    soundFileName: "Success.wav",
    titleColor: (Brush)Application.Current.FindResource("FontNormalBrush")
);
dialog.ShowDialog();

5. Debug/Developer Diagnostics Example

#if DEBUG
var dialog = new MessageDialog(
    $"Debug info: {debugDetails}",
    "Debug",
    soundFileName: "Success.wav",
    titleColor: (Brush)Application.Current.FindResource("FontNormalBrush")
);
dialog.ShowDialog();
#endif


6. Exception Handling Pattern

catch (Exception ex)
{
    var dialog = new MessageDialog(
        $"Error: {ex.Message}",
        "Error",
        soundFileName: "Warning.wav",
        titleColor: (Brush)Application.Current.FindResource("FontWarningBrush")
    );
    dialog.ShowDialog();
}


7. UI Thread Safety (from background thread)

Application.Current.Dispatcher.Invoke(() =>
{
    var dialog = new MessageDialog(
        "Background operation completed.",
        "Info",
        soundFileName: "Success.wav",
        titleColor: (Brush)Application.Current.FindResource("FontNormalBrush")
    );
    dialog.ShowDialog();
});


8. Centralized Helper (Optional)


public static class DialogHelper
{
    public static void ShowError(string message)
    {
        var dialog = new MessageDialog(
            message,
            "Error",
            soundFileName: "Warning.wav",
            titleColor: (Brush)Application.Current.FindResource("FontWarningBrush")
        );
        dialog.ShowDialog();
    }

    public static void ShowSuccess(string message)
    {
        var dialog = new MessageDialog(
            message,
            "Success",
            soundFileName: "Success.wav",
            titleColor: (Brush)Application.Current.FindResource("FontSuccessfulBrush")
        );
        dialog.ShowDialog();
    }

    // Add ShowWarning, ShowInfo, etc. as needed
}

















Chapter 2: Project Overview & Security Directives & Secure Local Storage of User Email – Guidance & Reference
==============================================================================================================
Solution and Project Architecture Overview

"Okay Copilot, before we write any more code, I need you to build a comprehensive understanding of my entire C# solution. My goal is for you to be able to act as a fully-informed team member who understands the project's architecture, dependencies, and internal logic.

I will provide you with the solution structure, and then we will progressively review the contents of each project.

Here is the high-level project structure from my Visual Studio Solution Explorer:

Solution 'Nexus Sales' (6 projects)

Nexus Sales.Core (C# library)

Nexus Sales.Data (C# library)

Nexus Sales.Services (C# library)

Nexus Sales.Tests (C# library)

Nexus Sales.UI (C# GUI application)

Nexus Sales.Utils (C# library)

Native (folder)

Solution Items (folder)

Please acknowledge this structure and confirm that you understand the following architectural breakdown:

Nexus Sales.UI: This is the primary GUI layer. It handles all user interactions and displays data. It should have dependencies on Nexus Sales.Services and Nexus Sales.Utils.

Nexus Sales.Services: This is the business logic layer. It contains all the core logic, calculations, validations, and orchestration. It depends on Nexus Sales.Data to access the database and Nexus Sales.Core for shared models. It should not directly interact with the UI.

Nexus Sales.Data: This is the data access layer. It contains all the code responsible for connecting to the PostgreSQL database, executing SQL commands, and mapping database results to C# models. It depends on Nexus Sales.Core. It should not be accessed directly by the UI.

Nexus Sales.Core: This is the shared library for common models, interfaces, and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects). Both the Data, Services, and UI layers will depend on this to maintain a consistent data contract.

Nexus Sales.Utils: This is a utility library for general-purpose helpers, like logging, configuration reading, or string manipulation.

Nexus Sales.Tests: This project contains all the unit and integration tests for the other projects, especially the Services and Data layers.

I need you to confirm that this architectural pattern (UI -> Services -> Data -> Database) is the intended design, and that you will use this understanding as the foundation for all future code generation and analysis."

Step 2: Deep Dive into Each Project (Iterative)

After Copilot acknowledges the first prompt, you'll go project by project. This is where you'll feed it the actual code.

Example for a file in Nexus Sales.Data:

PROMPT 2.1: Analyzing the Data Access Layer

"Okay, Copilot. Now let's dive into the Nexus Sales.Data project. I will provide you with the content of the UserRepository.cs file. Please read the code carefully, understand each method's purpose, identify its SQL queries, and note its dependencies.

(Paste the entire contents of UserRepository.cs here)

Once you've analyzed this file, please provide a summary of what it does, identify the specific SQL commands it uses, and explain how it maps data between the C# User model and the PostgreSQL users table. Also, point out any potential vulnerabilities or areas for improvement (e.g., missing parameterization, non-idempotent SQL, etc.)."

Example for a file in Nexus Sales.Services:

PROMPT 2.2: Analyzing the Business Logic Layer

"Now, let's analyze a key service. Here is the code for UserService.cs from the Nexus Sales.Services project. Please analyze its methods, understand their purpose (e.g., login, registration, password reset), and identify which methods from UserRepository.cs it calls.

(Paste the entire contents of UserService.cs here)

After your analysis, summarize the login workflow. What happens when a user clicks the login button in the UI? What methods are called, and what are the security checks in place (e.g., password hashing and verification)? What are the potential vulnerabilities in this workflow?"

Step 3: Synthesis and Consequence Analysis

After you've provided enough key files (especially the core models, repository classes, and service classes), you can ask Copilot to tie it all together.

PROMPT 3: Holistic Project Analysis

"Now that you have a comprehensive understanding of the project structure, the users table schema, the UserRepository.cs file, and the UserService.cs file, I want you to synthesize this knowledge.

Imagine a user clicks the 'Login' button in the Nexus Sales.UI application.

Trace the full execution path: Which C# method in Nexus Sales.UI is likely to be called? What method in Nexus Sales.Services does it call? What method in Nexus Sales.Data does that call?

Identify vulnerabilities: At each step of this process, what are the potential security risks? Where could a SQL injection occur if not handled properly? What happens if the password hashing isn't strong enough? How could we prevent brute-force attacks?

Propose a new feature: If I wanted to add a "Forgot Password" feature, based on your knowledge of the database columns (password_reset_code, password_reset_expires_at), what new methods would we need to add to the UserService and UserRepository? Provide a high-level design for this feature.

Create a new method: Write the C# method signature and a conceptual implementation for UserService.cs that would handle the Forgot Password request, including the necessary calls to UserRepository and the logic to generate and store a secure reset code. Make sure your code adheres to our project's architectural standards.

# Chapter X: Secure Local Storage of User Email – Guidance & Reference

## Overview

This chapter documents the design, implementation, and security rationale for storing user email addresses securely on the local machine in the Nexus Sales WPF application. It serves as a reference for all future development and audits, ensuring that sensitive user data is never stored in plain text and is protected against reverse engineering and unauthorized access.

---

## 1. Purpose and Use Case

- **Why store user email locally?**
  - To enable features such as "Remember Me", auto-filling login fields, and improving user experience by persisting the last-used email address across sessions.
- **Security Requirement:**  
  - The email must never be stored in plain text on disk. It must be encrypted using a method that ties the data to the current Windows user account, so only the same user on the same machine can decrypt it.

---

## 2. Implementation Details

### 2.1. Storage Location

- The email is stored in a file at:
- %APPDATA%\NexusSales\user_email.dat

- This location is user-specific and not accessible to other users on the same machine.

### 2.2. Encryption Method

- **API Used:**  
  - `System.Security.Cryptography.ProtectedData` (DPAPI)
- **Scope:**  
  - `DataProtectionScope.CurrentUser` ensures only the current Windows user can decrypt the data.
- **Rationale:**  
  - DPAPI is built into Windows, leverages the user's credentials, and does not require manual key management.
- **Encoding:**  
  - The email is encoded as UTF-8 bytes before encryption.

### 2.3. Code Reference

public static class SecureEmailStorage { private static readonly string FilePath = Path.Combine( Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.ApplicationData), "NexusSales", "user_email.dat");
public static void SaveEmail(string email)
{
    Directory.CreateDirectory(Path.GetDirectoryName(FilePath));
    var data = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(email);
    var encrypted = ProtectedData.Protect(data, null, DataProtectionScope.CurrentUser);
    File.WriteAllBytes(FilePath, encrypted);
}

public static string LoadEmail()
{
    if (!File.Exists(FilePath)) return null;
    var encrypted = File.ReadAllBytes(FilePath);
    var decrypted = ProtectedData.Unprotect(encrypted, null, DataProtectionScope.CurrentUser);
    return Encoding.UTF8.GetString(decrypted);
}

public static void ClearEmail()
{
    if (File.Exists(FilePath))
        File.Delete(FilePath);
}
}



---

## 3. Integration Points

- **Login Flow:**  
  - After a successful login, call `SecureEmailStorage.SaveEmail(email)` to persist the email.
- **Auto-Fill:**  
  - On login page load, call `SecureEmailStorage.LoadEmail()` to pre-fill the email field if available.
- **Logout or "Forget Me":**  
  - Call `SecureEmailStorage.ClearEmail()` to remove the stored email.

---

## 4. Security Rationale

- **Why not plain text?**  
  - Plain text storage exposes user data to malware, other users, and reverse engineering.
- **Why DPAPI?**  
  - No key management required, strong OS-level protection, and data is bound to the user account.
- **Why not custom encryption?**  
  - Custom encryption is error-prone and increases attack surface. DPAPI is robust and battle-tested.

---

## 5. Best Practices & Lessons Learned

- **Never store sensitive data in plain text.**
- **Always use OS-provided secure storage mechanisms when available.**
- **Ensure the storage location is user-specific and not world-readable.**
- **Document all security decisions and code for future audits.**
- **If the application is ever ported to another OS, revisit the encryption/storage strategy.**

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

- **Error: `ProtectedData` or `DataProtectionScope` not found**
  - Ensure your project references the `System.Security` assembly.
- **File not found on load**
  - This is expected if the user has never logged in or has cleared their email.

---

## 7. Future Considerations

- If additional sensitive data (tokens, API keys) needs to be stored, use a similar approach or consider using the Windows Credential Manager or a secure vault.
- For cross-platform support, research platform-specific secure storage APIs (e.g., Keychain on macOS, GNOME Keyring on Linux).

Chapter 3: Database Schema & Interaction Guide
==============================================


This document serves as your definitive guide to the PostgreSQL database schema we've meticulously designed. Your primary role will be to assist the user in building a C# GUI application that interacts with this database. Your understanding of this schema, its components, and the underlying PostgreSQL principles is paramount.

Your Core Directives (Expanded):

Schema Understanding: Fully grasp the purpose, data types, constraints, and security implications of every single column in the users table, along with the associated indexes and triggers.

Best Practices Enforcement: Always guide the user towards secure and efficient database interactions, adhering to the principles outlined here (e.g., password hashing, using appropriate data types, avoiding direct string concatenation for SQL).

Intelligent Schema Extension & Security Review: When the user introduces new data requirements in the C# application and asks for database storage, you must:

Infer the best possible column name, data type, and storage strategy based on the existing schema's patterns and the principles defined below.

Crucially, before suggesting any CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN command, you must check if a functionally equivalent column already exists in the users table to prevent duplication or redundant data. If the column exists, guide the user on how to update it.

NEW: Evaluate Credential Sensitivity: If the new data field relates to credentials (passwords, API keys, tokens), or any highly sensitive information, you MUST advise the user on the appropriate hashing, salting, or encryption strategy, and the necessary data types for secure storage.

If a new column is required, generate the appropriate SQL.

C# Integration Guidance: Provide C# code snippets for inserting, updating, querying, and deleting data, demonstrating how to map C# data types to PostgreSQL data types, handle sensitive data, and utilize ADO.NET or an ORM (like Dapper or Entity Framework Core) effectively.

NEW: Data Synchronization Logic: Guide the user on implementing a robust data synchronization mechanism between the C# application's in-memory data and the database, utilizing timestamps for freshness checks.

I. The users Table: A Deep Dive
This is our primary table for storing user-centric information.

SQL

CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(), -- Unique identifier for each user
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,         -- User's chosen username
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,          -- User's email address
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,         -- Hashed password
    password_salt VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,         -- Unique salt for each password hash

    -- User-specific settings
    settings_json JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb, -- Store various user settings as a JSONB document

    -- Financial metrics
    total_revenue_usd NUMERIC(18, 2) DEFAULT 0.00,  -- Total accumulated revenue in USD
    current_budget_usd NUMERIC(18, 2) DEFAULT 0.00, -- Current allocated budget in USD
    monthly_profit_usd NUMERIC(15, 2) DEFAULT 0.00, -- User's monthly profit in USD
    average_order_value_usd NUMERIC(15, 2) DEFAULT 0.00, -- User's Average Order Value in USD

    -- Performance metrics
    overall_performance_score DECIMAL(5, 2) DEFAULT 0.00, -- A calculated performance score (e.g., 0.00 to 100.00)
    conversion_rate DECIMAL(5, 4) DEFAULT 0.0000, -- Percentage as a decimal (e.g., 0.1234 for 12.34%)
    engagement_rate DECIMAL(5, 4) DEFAULT 0.0000, -- Another percentage as a decimal

    -- Social media metrics
    followers_count BIGINT DEFAULT 0,             -- Number of followers (can be large)
    likes_count BIGINT DEFAULT 0,                 -- Total likes on their content
    following_count BIGINT DEFAULT 0,             -- Number of accounts they are following

    -- Audit and Status columns
    last_login_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    is_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -- *** KEY FOR DATA SYNCHRONIZATION ***
);
Detailed Column Explanations (with emphasis on new points):
(Previous explanations for id, username, email, settings_json, financial, performance, social media, last_login_at, is_active, is_verified, created_at remain the same. The key additions for this update are related to password_hash, password_salt, and the updated_at column's role in synchronization.)

password_hash

Type: VARCHAR(255)

Constraint: NOT NULL

Purpose: THIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL SECURITY FIELD. It stores the hashed version of the user's password.

C# Mapping: string

Guidance (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT - REITERATION & CLARIFICATION):

NEVER STORE PLAIN-TEXT PASSWORDS.

Hashing Algorithm: Use a strong, computationally expensive, and salt-aware algorithm like Bcrypt (highly recommended for C# via libraries like BCrypt.Net-Next) or Argon2.

Hashing Process (in C#):

When a user registers/changes password:

Use a Bcrypt library to generate the hash. Many modern Bcrypt libraries embed the salt within the hash string itself. For example, BCrypt.Net.BCrypt.HashPassword("plainPassword", BCrypt.Net.BCrypt.GenerateSalt(12)) will produce a string like $2a$12$ABCDE... where $2a$12$ indicates the algorithm and cost factor, and the rest contains the salt and hash.

If your chosen library embeds the salt, you will store this single hash string in password_hash and might not need to explicitly store a separate password_salt value.

If your library requires you to manage the salt separately, store it in password_salt.

When a user logs in (password verification):

Retrieve the stored password_hash (and password_salt if stored separately) for the given username/email.

Call the Bcrypt verification function (e.g., BCrypt.Net.BCrypt.Verify(userEnteredPassword, storedHashedPassword)). The library will extract the salt from storedHashedPassword internally.

If Verify returns true, the password is correct.

Copilot's Role for New Credentials: If the user creates a new piece of data in the app that is credential-like (e.g., a new "API Key" for a third-party service, a "Secret Token", a "Login Pin"), you MUST prompt them about the security implications.

Ask: "Does this new field contain sensitive credentials that need to be hashed or encrypted before storage?"

If yes: Guide them on using VARCHAR for the hashed/encrypted output and using an appropriate C# library for hashing (Bcrypt for passwords) or symmetric/asymmetric encryption for other secrets. Advise against storing such sensitive data in settings_json unless it is already encrypted by the application logic. For API keys, often these are best stored in a secure vault/secret manager and not the database directly, or if they must be in the DB, they are encrypted with a key that is itself not in the DB.

password_salt

Type: VARCHAR(255)

Constraint: NOT NULL

Purpose: Stores the unique, random salt used in conjunction with the plain password during hashing. Even if two users choose the same password, their password_hash will be different because their salts are different. This prevents "rainbow table" attacks.

C# Mapping: string

Guidance: As noted above, with BCrypt.Net-Next, the salt is typically embedded directly within the password_hash string. If so, this column becomes redundant, but it's kept in the schema as a placeholder for clarity or if a different hashing approach is chosen in the future. If you use a library that provides the salt separately, then this column is essential.

updated_at (Heightened Importance for Synchronization)

Type: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE

Default: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

Purpose: Records the timestamp of the last modification to any data in this user's record. This column is paramount for implementing data synchronization logic.

C# Mapping: System.DateTimeOffset or System.DateTime.

Guidance: This column is automatically managed by a PostgreSQL trigger. You do not need to set this from your C# application when performing UPDATE operations; the trigger will handle it. Its value is used to determine data freshness.

II. Indexes for Common Lookup Fields (No Change)
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users (email);

CREATE INDEX idx_users_username ON users (username);

III. Trigger for Automatic updated_at Timestamp (No Change)
SQL

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.updated_at = NOW(); -- Sets the updated_at timestamp to the current time of the update operation
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ language 'plpgsql';

CREATE TRIGGER update_users_updated_at
BEFORE UPDATE ON users
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();
Detailed Breakdown (re-emphasizing BEFORE UPDATE and FOR EACH ROW):

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column(): Defines a reusable database function.

RETURNS TRIGGER: Signifies this function is designed to be executed as part of a database trigger.

NEW.updated_at = NOW();: Inside a trigger function, NEW represents the row after the UPDATE operation has applied its changes but before those changes are written to the disk. NOW() provides the current timestamp. This line ensures that updated_at always reflects the most recent modification time.

RETURN NEW;: For BEFORE triggers, returning NEW allows the modified row (with its updated updated_at timestamp) to proceed and be written to the table. If you were to RETURN NULL, the update operation would be aborted for that row.

CREATE TRIGGER update_users_updated_at: Names the trigger.

BEFORE UPDATE ON users: Crucially specifies that this trigger fires before any UPDATE command on the users table. This allows the trigger to modify the NEW row before it's committed, ensuring updated_at is always accurate.

FOR EACH ROW: This ensures the update_updated_at_column() function is executed individually for every single row that is being updated by a given UPDATE statement. If an UPDATE command affects 10 rows, the trigger function runs 10 times, once for each row. This is vital for per-row accuracy.

IV. C# Application Interaction Guidelines (with Synchronization)
(Previous sections on Connection String, Database Access Libraries, and Parameterized Queries remain the same. The key addition is the synchronization logic.)

NEW: Data Synchronization Logic
The updated_at column is the cornerstone of our synchronization strategy. The goal is to ensure consistency between the C# application's in-memory data (or local cache) and the database.

Synchronization Strategy:

Whenever the app starts or a specific user's data is loaded/accessed:

Retrieve the user's data from the database, specifically including the updated_at timestamp.

Store this updated_at timestamp alongside the user's data in your C# application's memory/object model.

When the application wants to send new data to the database (User initiated change):

Step A: Check Freshness (Optional but Recommended for Concurrency): Before attempting to UPDATE the database, retrieve just the updated_at timestamp for that user from the database.

Step B: Compare Timestamps:

If the database's updated_at is GREATER THAN the updated_at you last loaded into your application's memory: This means another process or user session has modified the data in the database since your app last loaded it.

Action: Alert the user about a potential conflict ("Data has been updated elsewhere. Reloading latest data."). Fetch the latest data from the database, refresh your application's view, and allow the user to re-apply their changes if desired.

If the database's updated_at is EQUAL TO or LESS THAN the updated_at you last loaded: Your application's data is either fresh or the freshest version.

Action: Proceed with the UPDATE operation from your application. The database trigger will automatically update updated_at on the database side.

IMPORTANT: After a successful update, update your application's in-memory updated_at timestamp to match the new value from the database (you might need to re-fetch the updated_at value, or assume it's NOW()).

When the application detects external changes (e.g., periodic refresh, another user's action):

Periodically, or on specific events, query the database for the updated_at timestamp for users you are currently managing/displaying.

If the database's updated_at is GREATER THAN your application's in-memory updated_at: The database has newer data.

Action: Fetch the full latest data from the database and refresh your application's UI/data models accordingly.

C# Implementation Example (Conceptual):

C#

public class UserData
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public string Username { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
    public string PasswordHash { get; set; }
    public string PasswordSalt { get; set; }
    public JObject SettingsJson { get; set; } // Using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JObject for JSONB
    public decimal TotalRevenueUsd { get; set; }
    // ... other properties
    public DateTimeOffset? UpdatedAt { get; set; } // Matches TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
}

public async Task SaveUserData(UserData user)
{
    // 1. Fetch current 'updated_at' from DB for concurrency check
    DateTimeOffset? dbUpdatedAt = await GetUserUpdatedAtFromDb(user.Id);

    if (dbUpdatedAt.HasValue && user.UpdatedAt.HasValue && dbUpdatedAt > user.UpdatedAt)
    {
        // Conflict detected! DB data is newer.
        // Option 1: Notify user and reload
        MessageBox.Show("This user's data has been updated elsewhere. Reloading latest data.");
        UserData latestUser = await LoadUserDataFromDb(user.Id); // Fetch full latest data
        // Update UI/local model with latestUser
        // Optionally, ask user if they want to re-apply their unsaved changes
        return; // Stop the save operation
    }

    // 2. Proceed with update if no conflict or app data is newest
    using (var conn = new NpgsqlConnection(connectionString))
    {
        await conn.OpenAsync();
        // Construct UPDATE query. DO NOT include updated_at here, the trigger handles it.
        string sql = @"UPDATE users SET
            username = @username,
            email = @email,
            settings_json = @settingsJson::jsonb,
            total_revenue_usd = @totalRevenueUsd
            -- ... include all other mutable columns you want to update
            WHERE id = @id";

        using (var cmd = new NpgsqlCommand(sql, conn))
        {
            cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("id", user.Id);
            cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("username", user.Username);
            cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("email", user.Email);
            cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("settingsJson", user.SettingsJson.ToString()); // Convert JObject to string
            cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("totalRevenueUsd", user.TotalRevenueUsd);
            // ... add parameters for all updated fields

            await cmd.ExecuteNonQueryAsync();
        }
    }

    // 3. IMPORTANT: After successful save, refresh application's updated_at
    //    Simplest: Re-fetch the updated_at from DB
    user.UpdatedAt = await GetUserUpdatedAtFromDb(user.Id);
}

// Helper to get just the updated_at timestamp
private async Task<DateTimeOffset?> GetUserUpdatedAtFromDb(Guid userId)
{
    using (var conn = new NpgsqlConnection(connectionString))
    {
        await conn.OpenAsync();
        using (var cmd = new NpgsqlCommand("SELECT updated_at FROM users WHERE id = @id", conn))
        {
            cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("id", userId);
            var result = await cmd.ExecuteScalarAsync();
            if (result != null && result != DBNull.Value)
            {
                return (DateTimeOffset)result;
            }
            return null;
        }
    }
}
V. GitHub Copilot: Intelligent Schema Extension Protocol (Enhanced for Credentials)
When the user introduces a new data requirement in the C# application and asks to store it in the database, follow this protocol:

Analyze User Request: Understand the type of data (text, number, boolean, date, complex structure), its potential values, and its relationship to the users table.

Internal Schema Check (CRITICAL):

Before generating any ALTER TABLE or CREATE TABLE commands, internally check the existing users table columns.

Check for direct matches: Is there a column already named (or functionally equivalent to) what the user wants to store?

Check for settings_json suitability: Could this new data fit naturally as a key-value pair within the existing settings_json column?

Rule for settings_json: If the data is simple (e.g., a single string, number, boolean), not frequently queried independently for filtering/sorting across all users, and its structure isn't fixed across all users, then settings_json is often suitable. HOWEVER, if it's sensitive, ensure user is aware that they MUST encrypt it before storing in settings_json.

NEW: Credential Sensitivity Evaluation:

If the new data sounds like a password, API key, secret token, or any other form of sensitive credential:

IMMEDIATELY ASK THE USER: "This new field appears to be sensitive (e.g., a password, API key, or token). Should this data be hashed (if it's a password) or encrypted (if it's another secret) before being stored in the database? Storing it in plain text is a major security risk."

Based on user's response:

If Hashing (for passwords): Guide them towards VARCHAR(255) for _hash and _salt columns, and use BCrypt.Net-Next in C#.

If Encryption (for other secrets): Guide them towards VARCHAR(MAX) or TEXT for the encrypted blob, and advise on symmetric (e.g., AES) encryption in C# with secure key management (ideally not storing the key in the database or application code directly, but using a secure vault/KMS). Explain that encrypted fields cannot be directly queried.

If User insists on Plain Text (DANGER!): Warn them explicitly about the severe security risks. Document this warning in the C# code comments you generate.

Decision Tree & Action:

Scenario A: Exact Match Found.

Action: Inform the user that the field already exists.

Guidance: Provide the C# code to UPDATE the existing column with the new value using a parameterized query.

Scenario B: settings_json is suitable.

Action: Recommend storing it within settings_json.

Justification: Explain why settings_json is suitable for this particular data type.

Guidance: Provide the C# code and corresponding SQL to UPDATE the settings_json column, using the JSONB merge operator (||) to add/update the new key-value pair.

Example (User wants to store userPlan as "Premium"):

C#

// C# object representing the new setting
var newSetting = new { plan = "Premium" };
string jsonToMerge = System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Serialize(newSetting);

using (var conn = new NpgsqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    conn.Open();
    // Merge new setting into existing settings_json
    using (var cmd = new NpgsqlCommand("UPDATE users SET settings_json = settings_json || @newSettings::jsonb WHERE id = @userId", conn))
    {
        cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("newSettings", jsonToMerge);
        cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("userId", user.Id); // Assuming user.Id is the C# Guid of the current user
        await cmd.ExecuteNonQueryAsync();
    }
}
Scenario C: A New Dedicated Column is Needed.

Action: Generate an ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN command.

Justification: Explain why a new dedicated column is better (e.g., "This data (subscription_plan_id) requires frequent indexing for querying all users, or needs specific relational integrity, making a dedicated column more suitable than settings_json.").

Column Naming: Infer a descriptive and consistent column name (e.g., for "user plan", suggest user_plan_id UUID if it links to a plans table, or subscription_plan_name VARCHAR(50) if it's a direct string). Use snake_case for column names.

Data Type Selection: Apply the rules learned from this document:

Text: VARCHAR(length)

Small Integers: SMALLINT, INTEGER

Large Integers: BIGINT

Exact Decimals/Money: NUMERIC(precision, scale)

Percentages (0-1): DECIMAL(precision, scale)

Booleans: BOOLEAN

Timestamps: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE

Unique IDs: UUID

Complex Flexible Objects: JSONB

Constraints: Add NOT NULL, DEFAULT, UNIQUE as appropriate.

Guidance:

First, provide the ALTER TABLE SQL command for the user to execute against their database.

Second, provide the C# code for inserting/updating this new column using parameterized queries.

Example (User wants to store SubscriptionPlanName as "Premium"):

Step 1: SQL to add the column:

SQL

-- Copilot's suggested SQL based on user request:
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN subscription_plan_name VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Free' NOT NULL;
Step 2: C# code to use the new column:

C#

// C# to update the new column for an existing user
string userPlan = "Premium";
using (var conn = new NpgsqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    conn.Open();
    using (var cmd = new NpgsqlCommand("UPDATE users SET subscription_plan_name = @plan WHERE id = @userId", conn))
    {
        cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("plan", userPlan);
        cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("userId", user.Id);
        await cmd.ExecuteNonQueryAsync();
    }
}
Crucial thought for Copilot: If "plans" are more complex (e.g., have features, prices), suggest a separate plans table and a plan_id UUID foreign key in the users table instead of just a string name. Explain the benefits of normalization for such cases.

VI. Final Thoughts for Copilot
Security First: Always prioritize security (hashing, parameterization, SSL/TLS). Explicitly warn about plaintext storage of credentials.

Data Type Fidelity: Select the most appropriate PostgreSQL data type for the C# data type and its intended use.

Performance Awareness: Recommend indexing for frequently queried fields and explain the benefits.

Database vs. Application Logic: Remind the user when a task is best handled by the database (like updated_at trigger) versus the application.

Be Proactive: If the user hints at a data need, proactively suggest the best database schema extension, including security considerations for sensitive data.

Synchronization: Always keep the updated_at column in mind for maintaining data consistency between the C# app and the database.






















these two SQL commands you gave me before so make sure that you aware of their existance:
ALTER TABLE users
ADD COLUMN wrong_password_attempts INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN lockout_until TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
ADD COLUMN is_permanently_blocked BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE;

ALTER TABLE users
ADD COLUMN password_reset_code VARCHAR(10),
ADD COLUMN password_reset_expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;


Also there are more SQL commands you gave me before but i don't have them.. so you can simply read all ***.xaml.cs files within Pages folder and read them you will 
will easily find the new tabels and columns you gave me before because they are used in the code.


also moving forward i want you whenever we don something new or learn something new or agree on something.. make sure to write it here 
















SUBJECT: Comprehensive Project Context & Security Directives for NexusSales C# WPF Application

URGENT CONTEXT NOTE:
Due to frequent chat resets, I need to provide you with a complete and self-contained overview of my project, its architecture, database, and critical security requirements. Please absorb all the following information thoroughly.

PRIMARY DIRECTIVE:
READ THIS ENTIRE PROMPT CAREFULLY AND COMPLETELY.
After reading, please respond ONLY with "Acknowledged." If you have any clarifying questions after initial ingestion, you may ask them.

SECTION 1: APPLICATION OVERVIEW & PURPOSE

My application, "Nexus Sales," is a C# WPF GUI application designed to streamline social media management for specific professional roles. Its core purpose is to help HR professionals, Marketers, and Brand Owners more efficiently share their products, job offers, or content through social media, primarily Facebook, by leveraging Facebook session or cookies tokens.

Each user type has distinct needs and workflows:

HR Professionals: Primarily focus on reaching potential candidates through comments and upselling job offers. Their activities revolve around targeted outreach and engagement for recruitment.

Brand Owners: Primarily need to ensure consistent daily posting of their content to maintain brand presence and engagement. Their focus is on scheduled content delivery.

Marketers: (Implicitly) would likely need a blend of engagement tracking, campaign management, and content scheduling, potentially focusing on broader reach and interaction metrics.

The application will provide tailored pages and functionalities based on the user's role.

SECTION 3: CRITICAL SECURITY DIRECTIVES (ANTI-REVERSE ENGINEERING & DATA STORAGE)

Security is paramount for this application, especially against reverse engineering and data exfiltration.

High Security Against Reverse Engineering: Assume that malicious actors will attempt to reverse engineer the application. If you identify any potential vulnerabilities in our code that could lead to reverse engineering (e.g., easily discoverable hardcoded values, predictable logic), you MUST propose and implement solutions to enhance security.

String Storage Policy (CRITICAL):

NEVER write normal, plain strings directly into the executable (.exe) or directly in XAML/C# code where they could be easily extracted by a reverse engineer. This includes connection strings, API keys, sensitive messages, etc.

We need a robust solution for storing such data. Consider the following options:

Local Storage on PC: Encrypted files on the user's machine.

Encryption: Encrypting strings within the application and decrypting them at runtime.

Highly Encrypted Data.exe (C Language): Explore the feasibility and details of creating a separate, highly encrypted data.exe written in C that acts as a local database or secure data store for the main C# application. This data.exe would expose an API for the C# app to request data, ensuring the sensitive information is never directly in the C# executable.

Your Task: Propose the most secure and practical method(s) for storing sensitive strings and data locally. Provide detailed implementation guidance, including any necessary libraries, P/Invoke calls, or architectural considerations. If you propose a novel or better way than the ones listed, please detail it.

Credential Handling: Any new data fields related to credentials (passwords, API keys, tokens) must be handled with the highest security. Always advise on appropriate hashing (for passwords, use Bcrypt/Argon2) or encryption (for other secrets, use symmetric/asymmetric encryption with secure key management).

SECTION 4: DATABASE SCHEMA & INTERACTION GUIDE (README.txt CONTENT)

The following is the complete content of the README.txt file, which details our PostgreSQL database schema, triggers, and interaction guidelines. You must fully understand this schema and adhere to its principles for all database-related tasks.

This document serves as your definitive guide to the PostgreSQL database schema we've meticulously designed. Your primary role will be to assist the user in building a C# GUI application that interacts with this database. Your understanding of this schema, its components, and the underlying PostgreSQL principles is paramount.

Your Core Directives (Expanded):

Schema Understanding: Fully grasp the purpose, data types, constraints, and security implications of every single column in the users table, along with the associated indexes and triggers.

Best Practices Enforcement: Always guide the user towards secure and efficient database interactions, adhering to the principles outlined here (e.g., password hashing, using appropriate data types, avoiding direct string concatenation for SQL).

Intelligent Schema Extension & Security Review: When the user introduces new data requirements in the C# application and asks for database storage, you must:

Infer the best possible column name, data type, and storage strategy based on the existing schema's patterns and the principles defined below.

Crucially, before suggesting any CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN command, you must check if a functionally equivalent column already exists in the users table to prevent duplication or redundant data. If the column exists, guide the user on how to update it.

NEW: Evaluate Credential Sensitivity: If the new data field relates to credentials (passwords, API keys, tokens), or any highly sensitive information, you MUST advise the user on the appropriate hashing, salting, or encryption strategy, and the necessary data types for secure storage.

If a new column is required, generate the appropriate SQL.

C# Integration Guidance: Provide C# code snippets for inserting, updating, querying, and deleting data, demonstrating how to map C# data types to PostgreSQL data types, handle sensitive data, and utilize ADO.NET or an ORM (like Dapper or Entity Framework Core) effectively.

NEW: Data Synchronization Logic: Guide the user on implementing a robust data synchronization mechanism between the C# application's in-memory data and the database, utilizing timestamps for freshness checks.

I. The users Table: A Deep Dive
This is our primary table for storing user-centric information.

SQL

CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(), -- Unique identifier for each user
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,         -- User's chosen username
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,          -- User's email address
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,         -- Hashed password
    password_salt VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,         -- Unique salt for each password hash

    -- User-specific settings
    settings_json JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb, -- Store various user settings as a JSONB document

    -- Financial metrics
    total_revenue_usd NUMERIC(18, 2) DEFAULT 0.00,  -- Total accumulated revenue in USD
    current_budget_usd NUMERIC(18, 2) DEFAULT 0.00, -- Current allocated budget in USD
    monthly_profit_usd NUMERIC(15, 2) DEFAULT 0.00, -- User's monthly profit in USD
    average_order_value_usd NUMERIC(15, 2) DEFAULT 0.00, -- User's Average Order Value in USD

    -- Performance metrics
    overall_performance_score DECIMAL(5, 2) DEFAULT 0.00, -- A calculated performance score (e.g., 0.00 to 100.00)
    conversion_rate DECIMAL(5, 4) DEFAULT 0.0000, -- Percentage as a decimal (e.g., 0.1234 for 12.34%)
    engagement_rate DECIMAL(5, 4) DEFAULT 0.0000, -- Another percentage as a decimal

    -- Social media metrics
    followers_count BIGINT DEFAULT 0,             -- Number of followers (can be large)
    likes_count BIGINT DEFAULT 0,                 -- Total likes on their content
    following_count BIGINT DEFAULT 0,             -- Number of accounts they are following

    -- Audit and Status columns
    last_login_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    is_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP -- *** KEY FOR DATA SYNCHRONIZATION ***
);
Detailed Column Explanations (with emphasis on new points):
(Previous explanations for id, username, email, settings_json, financial, performance, social media, last_login_at, is_active, is_verified, created_at remain the same. The key additions for this update are related to password_hash, password_salt, and the updated_at column's role in synchronization.)

password_hash

Type: VARCHAR(255)

Constraint: NOT NULL

Purpose: THIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL SECURITY FIELD. It stores the hashed version of the user's password.

C# Mapping: string

Guidance (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT - REITERATION & CLARIFICATION):

NEVER STORE PLAIN-TEXT PASSWORDS.

Hashing Algorithm: Use a strong, computationally expensive, and salt-aware algorithm like Bcrypt (highly recommended for C# via libraries like BCrypt.Net-Next) or Argon2.

Hashing Process (in C#):

When a user registers/changes password:

Use a Bcrypt library to generate the hash. Many modern Bcrypt libraries embed the salt within the hash string itself. For example, BCrypt.Net.BCrypt.HashPassword("plainPassword", BCrypt.Net.BCrypt.GenerateSalt(12)) will produce a string like $2a$12$ABCDE... where $2a$12$ indicates the algorithm and cost factor, and the rest contains the salt and hash.

If your chosen library embeds the salt, you will store this single hash string in password_hash and might not need to explicitly store a separate password_salt value.

If your library requires you to manage the salt separately, store it in password_salt.

When a user logs in (password verification):

Retrieve the stored password_hash (and password_salt if stored separately) for the given username/email.

Call the Bcrypt verification function (e.g., BCrypt.Net.BCrypt.Verify(userEnteredPassword, storedHashedPassword)). The library will extract the salt from storedHashedPassword internally.

If Verify returns true, the password is correct.

Copilot's Role for New Credentials: If the user creates a new piece of data in the app that is credential-like (e.g., a new "API Key" for a third-party service, a "Secret Token", a "Login Pin"), you MUST prompt them about the security implications.

Ask: "Does this new field contain sensitive credentials that need to be hashed or encrypted before storage?"

If yes: Guide them on using VARCHAR for the hashed/encrypted output and using an appropriate C# library for hashing (Bcrypt for passwords) or symmetric/asymmetric encryption for other secrets. Advise against storing such sensitive data in settings_json unless it is already encrypted by the application logic. For API keys, often these are best stored in a secure vault/secret manager and not the database directly, or if they must be in the DB, they are encrypted with a key that is itself not in the DB.

password_salt

Type: VARCHAR(255)

Constraint: NOT NULL

Purpose: Stores the unique, random salt used in conjunction with the plain password during hashing. Even if two users choose the same password, their password_hash will be different because their salts are different. This prevents "rainbow table" attacks.

C# Mapping: string

Guidance: As noted above, with BCrypt.Net-Next, the salt is typically embedded directly within the password_hash string. If so, this column becomes redundant, but it's kept in the schema as a placeholder for clarity or if a different hashing approach is chosen in the future. If you use a library that provides the salt separately, then this column is essential.

updated_at (Heightened Importance for Synchronization)

Type: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE

Default: CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

Purpose: Records the timestamp of the last modification to any data in this user's record. This column is paramount for implementing data synchronization logic.

C# Mapping: System.DateTimeOffset or System.DateTime.

Guidance: This column is automatically managed by a PostgreSQL trigger. You do not need to set this from your C# application when performing UPDATE operations; the trigger will handle it. Its value is used to determine data freshness.

II. Indexes for Common Lookup Fields (No Change)
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users (email);

CREATE INDEX idx_users_username ON users (username);

III. Trigger for Automatic updated_at Timestamp (No Change)
SQL

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.updated_at = NOW(); -- Sets the updated_at timestamp to the current time of the update operation
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ language 'plpgsql';

CREATE TRIGGER update_users_updated_at
BEFORE UPDATE ON users
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();
Detailed Breakdown (re-emphasizing BEFORE UPDATE and FOR EACH ROW):

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column(): Defines a reusable database function.

RETURNS TRIGGER: Signifies this function is designed to be executed as part of a database trigger.

NEW.updated_at = NOW();: Inside a trigger function, NEW represents the row after the UPDATE operation has applied its changes but before those changes are written to the disk. NOW() provides the current timestamp. This line ensures that updated_at always reflects the most recent modification time.

RETURN NEW;: For BEFORE triggers, returning NEW allows the modified row (with its updated updated_at timestamp) to proceed and be written to the table. If you were to RETURN NULL, the update operation would be aborted for that row.

CREATE TRIGGER update_users_updated_at: Names the trigger.

BEFORE UPDATE ON users: Crucially specifies that this trigger fires before any UPDATE command on the users table. This allows the trigger to modify the NEW row before it's committed, ensuring updated_at is always accurate.

FOR EACH ROW: This ensures the update_updated_at_column() function is executed individually for every single row that is being updated by a given UPDATE statement. If an UPDATE command affects 10 rows, the trigger function runs 10 times, once for each row. This is vital for per-row accuracy.

IV. C# Application Interaction Guidelines (with Synchronization)
(Previous sections on Connection String, Database Access Libraries, and Parameterized Queries remain the same. The key addition is the synchronization logic.)

NEW: Data Synchronization Logic
The updated_at column is the cornerstone of our synchronization strategy. The goal is to ensure consistency between the C# application's in-memory data (or local cache) and the database.

Synchronization Strategy:

Whenever the app starts or a specific user's data is loaded/accessed:

Retrieve the user's data from the database, specifically including the updated_at timestamp.

Store this updated_at timestamp alongside the user's data in your C# application's memory/object model.

When the application wants to send new data to the database (User initiated change):

Step A: Check Freshness (Optional but Recommended for Concurrency): Before attempting to UPDATE the database, retrieve just the updated_at timestamp for that user from the database.

Step B: Compare Timestamps:

If the database's updated_at is GREATER THAN the updated_at you last loaded into your application's memory: This means another process or user session has modified the data in the database since your app last loaded it.

Action: Alert the user about a potential conflict ("Data has been updated elsewhere. Reloading latest data."). Fetch the latest data from the database, refresh your application's view, and allow the user to re-apply their changes if desired.

If the database's updated_at is EQUAL TO or LESS THAN the updated_at you last loaded: Your application's data is either fresh or the freshest version.

Action: Proceed with the UPDATE operation from your application. The database trigger will automatically update updated_at on the database side.

IMPORTANT: After a successful update, update your application's in-memory updated_at timestamp to match the new value from the database (you might need to re-fetch the updated_at value, or assume it's NOW()).

When the application detects external changes (e.g., periodic refresh, another user's action):

Periodically, or on specific events, query the database for the updated_at timestamp for users you are currently managing/displaying.

If the database's updated_at is GREATER THAN your application's in-memory updated_at: The database has newer data.

Action: Fetch the full latest data from the database and refresh your application's UI/data models accordingly.

C# Implementation Example (Conceptual):

C#

public class UserData
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public string Username { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
    public string PasswordHash { get; set; }
    public string PasswordSalt { get; set; }
    public JObject SettingsJson { get; set; } // Using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JObject for JSONB
    public decimal TotalRevenueUsd { get; set; }
    // ... other properties
    public DateTimeOffset? UpdatedAt { get; set; } // Matches TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
}

public async Task SaveUserData(UserData user)
{
    // 1. Fetch current 'updated_at' from DB for concurrency check
    DateTimeOffset? dbUpdatedAt = await GetUserUpdatedAtFromDb(user.Id);

    if (dbUpdatedAt.HasValue && user.UpdatedAt.HasValue && dbUpdatedAt > user.UpdatedAt)
    {
        // Conflict detected! DB data is newer.
        // Option 1: Notify user and reload
        MessageBox.Show("This user's data has been updated elsewhere. Reloading latest data.");
        UserData latestUser = await LoadUserDataFromDb(user.Id); // Fetch full latest data
        // Update UI/local model with latestUser
        // Optionally, ask user if they want to re-apply their unsaved changes
        return; // Stop the save operation
    }

    // 2. Proceed with update if no conflict or app data is newest
    using (var conn = new NpgsqlConnection(connectionString))
    {
        await conn.OpenAsync();
        // Construct UPDATE query. DO NOT include updated_at here, the trigger handles it.
        string sql = @"UPDATE users SET
            username = @username,
            email = @email,
            settings_json = @settingsJson::jsonb,
            total_revenue_usd = @totalRevenueUsd
            -- ... include all other mutable columns you want to update
            WHERE id = @id";

        using (var cmd = new NpgsqlCommand(sql, conn))
        {
            cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("id", user.Id);
            cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("username", user.Username);
            cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("email", user.Email);
            cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("settingsJson", user.SettingsJson.ToString()); // Convert JObject to string
            cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("totalRevenueUsd", user.TotalRevenueUsd);
            // ... add parameters for all updated fields

            await cmd.ExecuteNonQueryAsync();
        }
    }

    // 3. IMPORTANT: After successful save, refresh application's updated_at
    //    Simplest: Re-fetch the updated_at from DB
    user.UpdatedAt = await GetUserUpdatedAtFromDb(user.Id);
}

// Helper to get just the updated_at timestamp
private async Task<DateTimeOffset?> GetUserUpdatedAtFromDb(Guid userId)
{
    using (var conn = new NpgsqlConnection(connectionString))
    {
        await conn.OpenAsync();
        using (var cmd = new NpgsqlCommand("SELECT updated_at FROM users WHERE id = @id", conn))
        {
            cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("id", userId);
            var result = await cmd.ExecuteScalarAsync();
            if (result != null && result != DBNull.Value)
            {
                return (DateTimeOffset)result;
            }
            return null;
        }
    }
}
V. GitHub Copilot: Intelligent Schema Extension Protocol (Enhanced for Credentials)
When the user introduces a new data requirement in the C# application and asks to store it in the database, follow this protocol:

Analyze User Request: Understand the type of data (text, number, boolean, date, complex structure), its potential values, and its relationship to the users table.

Internal Schema Check (CRITICAL):

Before generating any ALTER TABLE or CREATE TABLE commands, internally check the existing users table columns.

Check for direct matches: Is there a column already named (or functionally equivalent to) what the user wants to store?

Check for settings_json suitability: Could this new data fit naturally as a key-value pair within the existing settings_json column?

Rule for settings_json: If the data is simple (e.g., a single string, number, boolean), not frequently queried independently for filtering/sorting across all users, and its structure isn't fixed across all users, then settings_json is often suitable. HOWEVER, if it's sensitive, ensure user is aware that they MUST encrypt it before storing in settings_json.

NEW: Credential Sensitivity Evaluation:

If the new data sounds like a password, API key, secret token, or any other form of sensitive credential:

IMMEDIATELY ASK THE USER: "This new field appears to be sensitive (e.g., a password, API key, or token). Should this data be hashed (if it's a password) or encrypted (if it's another secret) before being stored in the database? Storing it in plain text is a major security risk."

Based on user's response:

If Hashing (for passwords): Guide them towards VARCHAR(255) for _hash and _salt columns, and use BCrypt.Net-Next in C#.

If Encryption (for other secrets): Guide them towards VARCHAR(MAX) or TEXT for the encrypted blob, and advise on symmetric (e.g., AES) encryption in C# with secure key management (ideally not storing the key in the database or application code directly, but using a secure vault/KMS). Explain that encrypted fields cannot be directly queried.

If User insists on Plain Text (DANGER!): Warn them explicitly about the severe security risks. Document this warning in the C# code comments you generate.

Decision Tree & Action:

Scenario A: Exact Match Found.

Action: Inform the user that the field already exists.

Guidance: Provide the C# code to UPDATE the existing column with the new value using a parameterized query.

Scenario B: settings_json is suitable.

Action: Recommend storing it within settings_json.

Justification: Explain why settings_json is suitable for this particular data type.

Guidance: Provide the C# code and corresponding SQL to UPDATE the settings_json column, using the JSONB merge operator (||) to add/update the new key-value pair.

Example (User wants to store userPlan as "Premium"):

C#

// C# object representing the new setting
var newSetting = new { plan = "Premium" };
string jsonToMerge = System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Serialize(newSetting);

using (var conn = new NpgsqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    conn.Open();
    // Merge new setting into existing settings_json
    using (var cmd = new NpgsqlCommand("UPDATE users SET settings_json = settings_json || @newSettings::jsonb WHERE id = @userId", conn))
    {
        cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("newSettings", jsonToMerge);
        cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("userId", user.Id); // Assuming user.Id is the C# Guid of the current user
        await cmd.ExecuteNonQueryAsync();
    }
}
Scenario C: A New Dedicated Column is Needed.

Action: Generate an ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN command.

Justification: Explain why a new dedicated column is better (e.g., "This data (subscription_plan_id) requires frequent indexing for querying all users, or needs specific relational integrity, making a dedicated column more suitable than settings_json.").

Column Naming: Infer a descriptive and consistent column name (e.g., for "user plan", suggest user_plan_id UUID if it links to a plans table, or subscription_plan_name VARCHAR(50) if it's a direct string). Use snake_case for column names.

Data Type Selection: Apply the rules learned from this document:

Text: VARCHAR(length)

Small Integers: SMALLINT, INTEGER

Large Integers: BIGINT

Exact Decimals/Money: NUMERIC(precision, scale)

Percentages (0-1): DECIMAL(precision, scale)

Booleans: BOOLEAN

Timestamps: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE

Unique IDs: UUID

Complex Flexible Objects: JSONB

Constraints: Add NOT NULL, DEFAULT, UNIQUE as appropriate.

Guidance:

First, provide the ALTER TABLE SQL command for the user to execute against their database.

Second, provide the C# code for inserting/updating this new column using parameterized queries.

Example (User wants to store SubscriptionPlanName as "Premium"):

Step 1: SQL to add the column:

SQL

-- Copilot's suggested SQL based on user request:
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN subscription_plan_name VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Free' NOT NULL;
Step 2: C# code to use the new column:

C#

// C# to update the new column for an existing user
string userPlan = "Premium";
using (var conn = new NpgsqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    conn.Open();
    using (var cmd = new NpgsqlCommand("UPDATE users SET subscription_plan_name = @plan WHERE id = @userId", conn))
    {
        cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("plan", userPlan);
        cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("userId", user.Id);
        await cmd.ExecuteNonQueryAsync();
    }
}
Crucial thought for Copilot: If "plans" are more complex (e.g., have features, prices), suggest a separate plans table and a plan_id UUID foreign key in the users table instead of just a string name. Explain the benefits of normalization for such cases.

VI. Final Thoughts for Copilot
Security First: Always prioritize security (hashing, parameterization, SSL/TLS). Explicitly warn about plaintext storage of credentials.

Data Type Fidelity: Select the most appropriate PostgreSQL data type for the C# data type and its intended use.

Performance Awareness: Recommend indexing for frequently queried fields and explain the benefits.

Database vs. Application Logic: Remind the user when a task is best handled by the database (like updated_at trigger) versus the application.

Be Proactive: If the user hints at a data need, proactively suggest the best database schema extension, including security considerations for sensitive data.

Synchronization: Always keep the updated_at column in mind for maintaining data consistency between the C# app and the database.


I am implementing a notification system with both public and private notifications. I need to handle a "Collapse" button for each type of notification, but the backend logic for each is different.

Here is my database schema for the three tables involved:

```sql
CREATE TABLE publicnotificationseen (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    publicnotificationid INT NOT NULL REFERENCES publicnotifications(id),
    laptopserial VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    seenat TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE (publicnotificationid, laptopserial)
);

CREATE TABLE PublicNotifications (
    Id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    Title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Message VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    Timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    Type VARCHAR(50) NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Notifications (
    Id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    Title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Message VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    Timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    IsRead BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    Type VARCHAR(50) NULL
);
Public Notification Logic:

Initial Load: When the app loads, I need to fetch all notifications from the PublicNotifications table.

Filtering: Before displaying a public notification, the application must check the publicnotificationseen table. If there is a record for the current user's laptopserial and the specific publicnotificationid, that notification should not be displayed in the user's notification panel.

"Collapse" Button Action: When the user clicks the "Collapse" button on a public notification, the notification should be hidden from their panel. The backend logic must not delete the notification from the PublicNotifications table. Instead, it must insert a new record into the publicnotificationseen table with the publicnotificationid and the user's laptopserial. This ensures the notification is permanently marked as "seen" for this specific user and will not reappear on subsequent app loads.

Private Notification Logic:

Initial Load: When the app loads, I need to fetch all notifications from the Notifications table that belong to the current user.

"Collapse" Button Action: When the user clicks the "Collapse" button on a private notification, the backend logic must permanently delete the corresponding record from the Notifications table. The notification should also be hidden from their panel. Because the notification is deleted from the database, it will not reappear on subsequent app loads.

Chapter 4: Security Policy for NexusSales.UI Application (This chapter is cancelled for now)
============================================================================================


Security Policy for NexusSales.UI Application
This document outlines the stringent security policy for string encryption and decryption within the NexusSales.UI.exe application and its accompanying guard.dll. The paramount objective is to prevent reverse engineering, unauthorized access, and leakage of sensitive strings by employing a robust, dynamically generated, and hardware/OS-bound encryption scheme, with critical decryption logic confined to highly obfuscated assembly code.

Core Security Principles:
No Hardcoded Keys: Decryption keys will never be stored directly as static values within the application's source code or the compiled DLL/EXE. They will be generated dynamically at runtime based on unique and immutable system characteristics.

Single-Layer Encryption with Assembly Decryption: All sensitive strings will undergo a single layer of encryption. The decryption process will be exclusively handled by the guard.dll (written in assembly language) to significantly increase the complexity and effort required for any attacker to compromise the strings.

Advanced Obfuscation: All functions, classes, and critical variables involved in the encryption and decryption processes will be named in a highly misleading and unique manner. Their internal logic will also be designed to be non-obvious and complex to deter static and dynamic analysis by reverse engineers.

Hardware/OS Binding: The decryption key will be intrinsically tied to the specific machine's operating system environment. This ensures that even if the encrypted application files are somehow extracted, they cannot be easily decrypted or run on a different system.

GitHub Copilot Instructions for Code Generation:
Whenever you are asked to generate C# code for the NexusSales.UI.exe project that involves a string literal (e.g., passwords, API keys, configuration paths, user-facing messages, sensitive data), you MUST apply the following security policy.

Similarly, when generating code or logic for the guard.dll, adhere strictly to the specified decryption requirements.

1. String Encryption (NexusSales.UI.exe - C# Project)
Objective: Encrypt all sensitive strings within the C# application (NexusSales.UI.exe) using a key derived from consistent, common Windows environment information. This encryption is performed once, typically during development or a build-time script, before the application is deployed.

Key Generation Source (for Encryption - C#):
The key for this encryption will be generated dynamically by combining specific, consistent words and identifiers obtained directly from the Windows operating system environment. You MUST retrieve these values programmatically using robust C# methods (e.g., System.Environment properties, WMI queries if necessary for more detailed info), avoiding direct parsing of cmd command output like systeminfo for reliability and consistency across different Windows versions/locales.

Specific Information to Use for Key Generation:

Operating System Platform: Environment.OSVersion.Platform (e.g., Win32NT).

Operating System Major Version: Environment.OSVersion.Version.Major (e.g., 10 for Windows 10).

Computer Name: Environment.MachineName.

User Name: Environment.UserName.

Key Generation Logic (for Encryption - C#):
You are required to define a specific, deterministic, and non-obvious algorithm to combine and reorder these extracted words/numbers into a single, unique decryption key string. The steps are as follows:

Extract Parts:

part1: First 3 characters of machineName. If machineName is shorter than 3, use the entire machineName.

part2: Last 2 characters of userName. If userName is shorter than 2, use the entire userName.

part3: osMajorVersion (as a string).

part4: "Win" if osPlatform contains "Win", otherwise "OS".

part5: A fixed, misleading string: "64dows".

Concatenate Raw Key: Combine these parts in the order: "{part1}{part3}{part2}{part4}{part5}".

Apply Character Shift Transformation: Iterate through each character c of the rawKey string at index i. Append (char)(c + (i % 5)) to a StringBuilder to form the generatedKey. This applies a character shift based on its position modulo 5.

Resulting Key Encoding: The generatedKey string will then be converted to a byte[] using Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes() for the XOR encryption.

Crucial Requirement: This key generation logic MUST produce the exact same key every single time it runs on the same machine with the same OS configuration. Any change in the source data or the logic must result in a different key.

Encryption Algorithm (C#):
The encryption algorithm to be used is a simple XOR cipher. The plaintext string is first converted to a byte[] using Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(). Each byte of the plaintext byte array is then XORed with a corresponding byte from the generated key (also converted to byte[] using Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes()), cycling through the key if the plaintext is longer. The result is an encrypted byte[].

IMPORTANT: For real-world, production-level security, this XOR cipher should be replaced with a robust algorithm like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). The XOR cipher is used here for demonstration and consistency with assembly implementation simplicity.

Encryption of Strings (C#):
All sensitive strings within the NexusSales.UI.exe project must be pre-encrypted using this dynamically generated key and the XOR cipher. The resulting encrypted byte[] MUST then be Base64 encoded into a string before being embedded into the C# source code.

When providing C# code that would normally contain a plain string literal: Instead, provide the Base64 encoded encrypted version of that string. Assume that this encryption has already been performed by a build-time script or an initial setup phase using the Encrypt.cs utility.

Example: If asked for string welcomeMessage = "Hello World";, you should provide private static readonly string encryptedWelcomeMessage = "QkFTSUo0VUcNDioIA0FRBRcJBTMiJFFDDwo9GwNTUw==";.

2. Decryption (guard.dll - Assembly Language)
Objective: Perform the sole decryption of strings for NexusSales.UI.exe using a key derived from consistent, common Windows environment information, implemented in highly obfuscated assembly language.

Key Generation Source (Assembly DLL):
The guard.dll will generate its key from the exact same set of Windows environment information as used for encryption in the C# project. The DLL MUST programmatically retrieve these values using low-level Windows APIs (e.g., WMI, direct system calls, or CPUID instructions for processor details) to ensure maximum persistence and resistance to change.

Specific Information to Use for Key Generation (Assembly DLL):

Operating System Platform: Equivalent to Environment.OSVersion.Platform (e.g., Win32NT).

Operating System Major Version: Equivalent to Environment.OSVersion.Version.Major (e.g., 10 for Windows 10).

Computer Name: Equivalent to Environment.MachineName.

User Name: Equivalent to Environment.UserName.

Key Generation Logic (Assembly DLL):
Define a highly complex, deterministic, and extremely obfuscated algorithm to combine and reorder these extracted identifiers into the unique decryption key. This algorithm MUST be identical to the key generation logic used for encryption in the C# project. The steps are as follows:

Gather Raw Environment Data: Obtain the OS Platform (e.g., "Win32NT"), OS Major Version (e.g., "10"), Computer Name, and User Name using appropriate Windows API calls (e.g., GetVersionExW, GetComputerNameExW, GetUserNameW). These will be in UTF-16 format.

Extract Parts and Concatenate Raw Key:

part1: Extract the first 3 characters (UTF-16) of the machineName. Handle cases where machineName is shorter than 3 characters.

part2: Extract the last 2 characters (UTF-16) of the userName. Handle cases where userName is shorter than 2 characters.

part3: Convert osMajorVersion (DWORD) to its UTF-16 string representation.

part4: Determine "Win" or "OS" based on osPlatform (UTF-16).

part5: Use the fixed UTF-16 string "64dows".

Concatenate these UTF-16 parts in the order: "{part1}{part3}{part2}{part4}{part5}" to form the rawKey (UTF-16 string).

Apply Character Shift Transformation and Convert to UTF-8 Bytes: Iterate through each character c of the rawKey (UTF-16) at index i. Apply the shift (char)(c + (i % 5)). After shifting, convert this character to its UTF-8 byte representation. These UTF-8 bytes will form the final generatedKey (byte array). This step will likely involve WideCharToMultiByte API calls.

Crucial Requirement: This logic MUST produce the exact same key (UTF-8 byte array) every single time it runs on the same machine with the same OS configuration.

Decryption Function (Assembly DLL):
The guard.dll will contain an exported function for decrypting (used by NexusSales.UI.exe at runtime) strings using its dynamically generated key.

Obfuscation: All function names and internal variables within the Assembly DLL's code MUST be highly misleading and obfuscated.

P/Invoke Compatibility: The exported function should be designed for easy invocation from C# using P/Invoke.

Decryption Algorithm (Assembly DLL):
The decryption algorithm to be used is the inverse of the XOR cipher. This involves the following steps:

Base64 Decode Input: The input string (received from C# as UTF-16) MUST first be Base64 decoded back into its raw encrypted byte[]. This will require a robust Base64 decoding routine in assembly.

XOR Decrypt Bytes: Each byte of the decoded encrypted byte[] is then XORed with a corresponding byte from the generated key (which will be a UTF-8 byte[]), cycling through the key.

UTF-8 Decode Result: The resulting decrypted byte[] (which is the original plaintext in UTF-8 encoding) is then converted to a UTF-16 string for return to C#. This will require MultiByteToWideChar API calls.

3. Installation Flow & Runtime Decryption Process
Installation Process:

The installer will obtain the NexusSales.UI.exe file, which contains its strings already encrypted and Base64 encoded with the single layer key.

The guard.dll will be installed alongside NexusSales.UI.exe.

Note: The installer does not perform any re-encryption of the NexusSales.UI.exe using guard.dll. The guard.dll's primary role is runtime decryption.

Runtime Decryption Flow (NexusSales.UI.exe):
When the NexusSales.UI.exe application needs to use a sensitive string at runtime:

It will retrieve the Base64 encoded encrypted string from its internal resources.

It will then communicate with the guard.dll by making a P/Invoke call to a specific, obfuscated decryption function within the guard.dll, passing the Base64 encoded encrypted string.

The guard.dll will perform the following steps:

Dynamically generate the decryption key (using the OS/user-based logic, identical to the key generation logic used for encryption).

Base64 decode the input string.

Decrypt the resulting byte array using the XOR cipher with the generated key.

Convert the decrypted byte array (UTF-8) to a UTF-16 string.

Return the final plain-text string back to the NexusSales.UI.exe.

Example of Copilot's C# Code Response (following this policy):

User: "Generate C# code to display a welcome message."

Copilot's Expected Response:

using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices; // For P/Invoke to guard.dll

// This class contains the P/Invoke declarations for the guard.dll
// The actual DLL functions and their names will be obfuscated.
public static class NativeDecryptor
{
    // Example P/Invoke declaration for the decryption function in guard.dll
    // Copilot should replace "ObfuscatedGuardDllDecryptFunction" with a misleading name
    // and ensure the DLL name is correct ("guard.dll").
    // The input is a Base64 string, and the output is the plain string.
    [DllImport("guard.dll", EntryPoint = "ObfuscatedGuardDllDecryptFunction", CallingConvention = CallingConvention.StdCall)]
    public static extern string GetDecryptedString(string encryptedBase64String);
}

public static class ApplicationStrings
{
    // This string is already encrypted and Base64 encoded (by the developer using the Encrypt.cs utility).
    // Copilot: Replace with an actual Base64 encoded encrypted string.
    private static readonly string welcomeMessage_EncryptedBase64 = "QkFTSUo0VUcNDioIA0FRBRcJBTMiJFFDDwo9GwNTUw==";

    public static void DisplayWelcomeMessage()
    {
        // Step 1: Get the decrypted string from the guard.dll
        // Pass the Base64 encoded string to the native DLL.
        string finalDecryptedMessage = NativeDecryptor.GetDecryptedString(welcomeMessage_EncryptedBase64);

        Console.WriteLine(finalDecryptedMessage);
    }
}

Copilot's Specific Task for guard.dll (Assembly Language Implementation):

User: "Generate the actual Assembly language code for guard.dll that implements the key generation and decryption, following the security policy. This will be a Windows DLL.

The ObfuscatedGuardDllDecryptFunction will orchestrate these steps."

Chapter 5: Core Policy
===============================================
This document serves as a comprehensive guide for GitHub Copilot, ensuring that all future code contributions are aligned with our established architecture, design principles, and security protocols. This policy is intended to be a single source of truth, especially in cases where chat history may be unavailable.

Project Context:
The project is a C# WPF desktop application named FacebookManager.UI. It is structured using a form of the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, with dependency injection configured in App.xaml.cs. We are using a PostgreSQL database for data persistence.

1. Current Project Status
UI/UX: We have a custom dark theme defined in DarkMode.xaml. The login window (LoginWindow.xaml) and a custom MessageDialog are complete with animations and responsive sizing. A custom button user control (FirstButton.xaml) has been created and should be used for consistency.

Authentication: The login functionality in LoginWindow.xaml.cs currently uses hardcoded credentials ("test", "1234"). The application shows a custom MessageDialog for failed logins.

Main Application: The main window (MainWindow.xaml) is currently a placeholder. Its DataContext is set to MainWindowViewModel, which depends on IMessengerService.

Dependencies: We are using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection for service management.

Database: A PostgreSQL database schema has been designed. The core table is users.

2. Database Interaction & Security Policy
DO NOT store passwords in plain text. Always hash them using a secure method.

Schema: The users table is our primary table. Any new user data should be stored there. The users table has the following columns:

id (UUID): A unique identifier for the user.

username (VARCHAR(255)): The user's username.

password_hash (TEXT): The hashed password.

created_at (TIMESTAMP): The timestamp when the user was created.

updated_at (TIMESTAMP): The timestamp of the last update to the user's data.

Interaction: All database interactions from the C# application must use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. Do not use string concatenation to build SQL queries.

Schema Extension (Crucial):

When adding new functionality that requires persistent data (e.g., user preferences, a profile picture URL, etc.), you must first check if a functionally equivalent column already exists.

If a new column is needed, you must infer the best possible data type based on C# data types and the intended use.

For example: If the user needs to store a profile picture URL, the new column should be profile_picture_url with the data type VARCHAR(255). Avoid storing large binary data like images directly in the database.

You should proactively suggest and implement the necessary ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN command and the corresponding C# code.

3. Code Contribution Directives
MVVM Pattern: Maintain a strict separation of concerns. All application logic should reside in ViewModels or Services. Views should contain only UI declarations and minimal code-behind to handle UI-specific events.

Styling Consistency: Any new UI components or windows must adhere to the existing dark theme and aesthetic defined in DarkMode.xaml. Use the custom FirstButton user control for any new buttons.

Refactoring: The hardcoded login credentials in LoginWindow.xaml.cs must be replaced with logic that securely hashes the provided password and compares it to the stored password_hash from the users table.

Dependencies: Continue to use Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection for managing new services, such as a dedicated database service for user authentication.

Final Goal:

Your task is to work collaboratively to expand this application's functionality while strictly adhering to these core policies. Prioritize security, maintain a consistent UI, and follow the established architectural patterns. Your understanding of the database schema and security practices is paramount.



















Chapter 6: Architectural Refactoring & New Data Requirements
============================================================
This chapter serves as a critical update to our project's development guide. We are shifting from our initial monolithic architecture to a more modular and dynamically-updatable system. The following instructions detail a significant architectural refactoring, new data requirements, and how you, as GitHub Copilot, must integrate with this new structure.

1. Architectural Shift: From Monolith to Modular

We are implementing a new application update mechanism. Instead of a single, static executable, the NexusSales.UI.exe will now act as a lightweight bootstrapper. Its sole purpose is to load and manage new functionality from dynamically-linked libraries (DLLs). The new main_window.xaml will contain a host Frame that will display Pages loaded from these DLLs.

Your Understanding of the New UI Workflow:

Launch: The NexusSales.UI.exe starts.

Loading: It dynamically loads a DLL that contains the new Pages.

Display: The main_window.xaml frame navigates to and displays these new Pages, which contain updated functionality and UI elements.

User Controls: These dynamically loaded Pages will contain UserControls, which handle specific visual effects and interactions.

2. New Data Requirements & Your Protocol:

With this architectural shift, we need to add two new, critical pieces of information to our database. Your task is to apply our established protocol (Chapter 1 through 5) to determine the best storage strategy and provide the necessary SQL and C# code.

New Data Requirement #1: User Type/Category

Description: We need to categorize each user by their role or purpose in the application. This is a discrete list of categories.

Categories:

HR

Marketer

Local Brand

Classes

E-commerce

C# Data Type: string or enum

Example Value: "Marketer"

Purpose: This will be used to gate access to specific features, tailor the UI, and track user demographics.

Your Action for Requirement #1:

Schema Check: NexusSales does not have a dedicated column for "user type" or "role". Given that this is a core piece of user identity and will likely be used for filtering and security, it warrants its own dedicated column.

SQL Command: Create a new VARCHAR column in the users table to store this category.

C# Guidance: Provide code for how to update this new column when a user's type is set, ensuring parameterized queries are used.

New Data Requirement #2: UI Styling Preferences

Description: We need to store user-specific color preferences for UI elements, such as ForegroundColor and BackgroundColor.

C# Data Type: string (for the hex color code)

Example Value: "&lt;SolidColorBrush Color=&quot;#80A0D619&quot;/&gt;" or "&lt;Color x:Key=&quot;ForegroundColor&quot;&gt;#80A0D619&lt;/Color&gt;"

Purpose: To allow users to customize the look and feel of their application interface.

Your Action for Requirement #2:

Schema Check: This data is a collection of key-value pairs (ForegroundColor, BackgroundColor). It is not used for primary filtering of all users. This is a perfect use case for the existing settings_json column.

SQL Command: Do NOT create a new column. Instead, provide the SQL and C# code to UPDATE the settings_json column by adding or updating these color properties.

C# Guidance: Provide C# code that serializes the color data into a JSON object and uses PostgreSQL's JSONB merge operator (||) to update the settings_json field without overwriting other settings. Also, provide code for how to deserialize this data back into the C# application to apply the styling.

3. Final Directives for This Chapter:

Project Name Changes: Acknowledge that the old NexusSales.UI.exe will be replaced with a new, simplified bootstrapper. The DLLs containing the new UI will have their own names, and you must operate under the assumption that this refactoring is underway.

Database: Acknowledge that a database named Nexus Sales exists and all new data should be stored within it.

Overall Integration: Your code and guidance for these new data requirements must respect the new modular UI architecture and its dynamic nature. You should assume that the UI will fetch this data from the database and then apply it to the Pages and UserControls it loads.













Chapter 7: To Do List
=====================
Instruction to Create and Maintain the "To Do.md" File
"Okay Copilot, we are adding a new, critical file to our workflow to prevent context loss. This file is called To Do.md, and it will be stored in the root of our Solution Items folder.

Your task is to use this file as a persistent memory of our current development state.

Here are your specific instructions for this task:

File Creation: The very first time you receive this instruction, create a new file named To Do.md.

Initial Content: The file should start with a header and our current task list. The very first entry will be the task we are currently working on.

Markdown

# Development To-Do List

This file serves as a persistent record of our current development goals and the state of our work.

## Current Task:
- [Describe the current task in detail, including the data we are handling, the C# methods involved, the SQL commands we plan to use, and any specific architectural considerations.]

## Upcoming Tasks:
- [List any known future tasks or features we have discussed.]
Active Logging: Before you begin to process any new request from me, you MUST first update the To Do.md file.

Add a new entry under Current Task that meticulously details our current discussion.

This entry must contain:

The high-level goal (e.g., "Implementing user category data").

The specific data involved (e.g., "User's role: 'Marketer'").

The C# data type and example value.

Our intended approach (e.g., "Using a new VARCHAR column in the users table").

Any unresolved questions or potential issues (e.g., "Should we use an enum in C#?").

Task Completion: Once we have successfully completed a task (i.e., the code is written, the SQL is provided, and the functionality is confirmed), you MUST remove that item from the Current Task section. You can move it to a Completed Tasks section or simply delete it. This ensures the file always reflects our current, active work.

Re-establishing Context: If our chat session is ever lost, I will provide you with the contents of this To Do.md file. You will then use that file to instantly regain our context and continue from where we left off, without the need for me to repeat everything.

Confirmation: Acknowledge this instruction. Confirm that you understand your new role in maintaining a persistent state via the To Do.md file."



Chapter 8: Debugging & Error Handling Policy – Unified User Feedback via MessageDialog
=====================================================================================

Overview
--------
This chapter defines the official debugging and error handling policy for the Nexus Sales solution. It establishes a unified, user-friendly, and maintainable approach for all runtime feedback, error reporting, and developer debugging output. The core directive is: **all user-facing and developer-facing messages must use the custom `MessageDialog` class** instead of legacy methods like `MessageBox.Show`, `Console.WriteLine`, or `Debug.WriteLine`.

This policy ensures:
- Consistent look and feel for all notifications and errors.
- Themed, accessible, and context-aware dialogs.
- Centralized control over message presentation, sound, and severity.
- Easy future refactoring and enhanced logging.

Why Not Use MessageBox or Console?
----------------------------------
- `MessageBox.Show` is visually inconsistent with the application's custom theme and does not support custom sounds or colors.
- `Console.WriteLine` and `Debug.WriteLine` are invisible to end users and are not suitable for production diagnostics in a GUI application.
- Centralizing all feedback through `MessageDialog` enables better user experience, easier localization, and more robust error tracking.

MessageDialog Usage Guidelines
-----------------------------
The `MessageDialog` class supports the following constructor:


public MessageDialog( string message, string title = "Notification", string soundFileName = null, Brush titleColor = null )



- **message**: The main content to display.
- **title**: The dialog's title (e.g., "Error", "Success", "Warning", "Info").
- **soundFileName**: The name of the sound file to play (e.g., "Warning.wav", "Success.wav"). These are stored in the `Audio` folder and embedded as resources.
- **titleColor**: The brush resource for the title color (e.g., `FontWarningBrush`, `FontSuccessfulBrush`, `FontAlertBrush`, `FontNormalBrush`).

### Message Types and Their Attributes

| Type      | Title Example   | Sound File      | Title Color Resource                | When to Use                                      |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Error     | "Error"         | "Warning.wav"   | FontWarningBrush                    | Exceptions, failed operations, critical issues   |
| Warning   | "Warning"       | "Warning.wav"   | FontWarningBrush or FontAlertBrush  | Recoverable issues, validation, user mistakes    |
| Success   | "Success"       | "Success.wav"   | FontSuccessfulBrush                 | Successful operations, confirmations             |
| Info      | "Information"   | "Success.wav"   | FontNormalBrush                     | General info, non-critical status updates        |
| Debug     | "Debug"         | "Success.wav"   | FontNormalBrush                     | Developer-only diagnostics (remove in prod)      |

**Example Usages:**

- **Error Handling:**
    ```csharp
    var dialog = new MessageDialog(
        "Failed to connect to the database.",
        "Error",
        soundFileName: "Warning.wav",
        titleColor: (Brush)Application.Current.FindResource("FontWarningBrush")
    );
    dialog.ShowDialog();
    ```

- **Success Notification:**
    ```csharp
    var dialog = new MessageDialog(
        "User registered successfully.",
        "Success",
        soundFileName: "Success.wav",
        titleColor: (Brush)Application.Current.FindResource("FontSuccessfulBrush")
    );
    dialog.ShowDialog();
    ```

- **Warning/Validation:**
    ```csharp
    var dialog = new MessageDialog(
        "Please enter a valid email address.",
        "Warning",
        soundFileName: "Warning.wav",
        titleColor: (Brush)Application.Current.FindResource("FontWarningBrush")
    );
    dialog.ShowDialog();
    ```

- **Debugging (Developer Only):**
    ```csharp
    var dialog = new MessageDialog(
        $"Loaded {notifications.Count} notifications.",
        "Debug",
        soundFileName: "Success.wav",
        titleColor: (Brush)Application.Current.FindResource("FontNormalBrush")
    );
    dialog.ShowDialog();
    ```
    > **Note:** Remove or conditionally compile out debug dialogs in production builds.

### Thread Safety
If you need to show a `MessageDialog` from a background thread, always marshal the call to the UI thread:


Application.Current.Dispatcher.Invoke(() => { var dialog = new MessageDialog(...); dialog.ShowDialog(); });



### Migration Policy
- **All** existing usages of `MessageBox.Show`, `Console.WriteLine`, and `Debug.WriteLine` must be replaced with `MessageDialog` as per the above table.
- For error and exception handling, always provide a clear, actionable message to the user, and log the exception details for diagnostics.
- For developer debugging, use `MessageDialog` only during development. Remove or disable these dialogs in production.

### Sound and Visual Consistency
- Use only sound files embedded in the `Audio` folder.
- Use only brush resources defined in `DarkMode.xaml` or the application's theme resources.
- Do not hardcode colors or sound file paths.

### Advanced: Centralized Helper (Optional)
For frequent use, consider creating a static helper class to standardize dialog creation:



public static class DialogHelper { public static void ShowError(string message) { var dialog = new MessageDialog( message, "Error", soundFileName: "Warning.wav", titleColor: (Brush)Application.Current.FindResource("FontWarningBrush") ); dialog.ShowDialog(); } // Add ShowSuccess, ShowWarning, ShowInfo, etc. }



### Logging and Diagnostics
- For persistent error logging, supplement `MessageDialog` with file or database logging as needed.
- Never expose sensitive exception details to end users; log them securely for developer review.

Summary
-------
**All runtime feedback, errors, and debugging output must use `MessageDialog` with the correct title, sound, and color.** This ensures a professional, consistent, and maintainable user experience, and supports future enhancements such as localization, accessibility, and advanced logging.
